# RROSETTA

ROSETTA rough set classifier as a R package. In addition to all the existing ROSETTA (created by Ã–hrn and Komorowski in 1997) algorithms we have added new functions especially useful in bioinformatics applications. These include: under-sampling, p-value estimation of the rules, clustering decision classes, retrieving the true support sets for rules and reclassification.
