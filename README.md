# R.ROSETTA

**ROSETTA** rough set classifier as a R package. In addition to all the existing ROSETTA (created by Ã–hrn and Komorowski, 1997) algorithms we have added new functions especially useful in bioinformatics applications. 
These include: 
* under-sampling
* p-value estimation of the rules
* retrieving the support sets for rules
* class prediction
* rule heatmap

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
R.ROSETTA works with windows, linux and macOS platforms.<br />
For linux and macOS systems wine is required.<br />
<a href="https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/wine-mac/" target="_blank">A tutorial</a> by David Baumgold, how to install wine on macOS platforms.

### Installing

Installation from github requires devtools package:
```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

Installation and loading R.ROSETTA package from github:
```R
library(devtools)
install_github("mategarb/R.ROSETTA")

library(R.ROSETTA)
```
### Functions
**rosetta()** <-> *runs ROSETTA rough set classifier*<br />
**recalculateRules()** <-> *recalculates rules after according to decision table and retrieves the support sets for rules*<br />
**saveLineByLine()** <-> *saves rules to LineByLine format, compatible with VisuNet http://bioinf.icm.uu.se/~visunet/ and Ciruvis http://bioinf.icm.uu.se/~ciruvis/*<br />
**predictClass()** <-> *predicts outcome according to the model*<br />
**getFeatures()** <-> *retrieves the most significant features from the rules*<br />
**ruleHeatmap()** <-> *creates heatmap of support sets for a rule*<br />

## Examples

All the examples you can find by typing ? and the name of the function in R environment e.g.
```
?rosetta
```

## Acknowledgments
R.ROSETTA includes an example dataset obtained from GEO repository with the reference number [GSE25507](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE25507).


### Built With
* [ROSETTA](http://bioinf.icm.uu.se/rosetta/) - The ROSETTA framework
* [R Core](https://www.R-project.org/) - R Core Team
