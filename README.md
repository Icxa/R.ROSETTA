# RROSETTA

**ROSETTA** rough set classifier as a R package. In addition to all the existing ROSETTA (created by Ã–hrn and Komorowski in 1997) algorithms we have added new functions especially useful in bioinformatics applications. 
These include: 
* under-sampling
* p-value estimation of the rules
* clustering decision classes
* retrieving the support sets for rules
* reclassification

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
RROSETTA works with Windows and MacOS platforms.<br />
MacOS systems require wine.<br />
Wine installation tutorial by David Baumgold for MacOS platforms <a href="https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/wine-mac/" target="_blank">here</a>.
### Installing

Install and load devtools package
```R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

Install and load RROSETTA package from github
```R
install_github("mategarb/RROSETTA")
library(RROSETTA)
```
### Functions
**rosetta()** <-> *runs ROSETTA rough set classifier*<br />
**recalculateRules()** <-> *recalculates rules after undersampling and retrieves the support sets for rules*<br />
**saveLineByLine()** <-> *saves rules to LineByLine format, compatible with VisuNet http://bioinf.icm.uu.se/~visunet/*<br />
**getDecision()** <-> *reclassifies created model by applying rules*<br />
**getFeatures()** <-> *retrieves the most significant features from rules*<br />
