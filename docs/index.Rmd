R.ROSETTA is an R package for constructing and analyzing rule-based classification models. R.ROSETTA is designed to support the overall data mining and knowledge discovery process. The presented tool is a more accessible and extended version of ROSETTA (Ã–hrn and Komorowski, 1997) system.

In addition to all the existing ROSETTA functionalities, we have added new functions such as:

  + undersampling
  + estimating rule p-value
  + retrieving support sets from rules
  + predicting unseen classes
  + visualizing rule-based model (rule network, heatmap, boxplot)
  + generating synthetic data
